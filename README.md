<h4> Description </h4>
The 0x16. C - Simple Shell is a command line interpreter and shell script language designed to replicate the functionality and behavior of the sh shell.
In alignment with our educational journey, this project aims to enhance our understanding of low-level system programming while providing a useful tool for the developer community.
Our shell is intended to be simple and comprehensible while offering essential features that facilitate command execution, scripting, and navigation.
Using the Simple Shell is similar to traditional Unix shells. You can execute commands, navigate directories, and utilize various utilities.
